# How to Contribute

Since Codiad is still early in development we're very open about how contributions are made, however, to keep order to things please take the following 
into consideration:

* Check the issues to ensure that someone else isn't already working on the bug or feature
* Submit an issue for bugs and feature additions
* Familiarize yourself with the documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Codiad/wiki)

There is an established format for `components` which utilizes one JS (`init.js`) and on CSS (`screen.css`) which is handled by the loader file. Any other 
resources used should be loaded or accessed from one of these.
